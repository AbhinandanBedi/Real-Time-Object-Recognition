#Real Time Object Recognition
Real Time object recognition using Apple's CoreML and Vision API

In this project I have used device's Back camera to capture frames and recognise the objects in real time using CoreML and Vision.

The CoreML model used is Inceptionv3.

Also, whenever the camera detects a new object, it speaks it out.
